# CV-Mouse-Control
The purpose of this project is to provide a different and interesting option for user interaction with a computer. It uses OpenCV and Google's MediaPipe library to detect the location of the hand, providing control to the user. <br>
Currently, the project runs at a very low framerate and is generally unoptimized all-around. Making the project run better is on my todo list, and will be addressed soon.

# Instructions for Use
The program tracks the location of the tip of your pointer finger. <br>
To left-click, bring together the tip of your thumb and your middle finger. To right click, bring together the tip of your thumb and your ring finger.
